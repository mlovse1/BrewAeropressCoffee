# BrewAeropressCoffee
SWDV665-Final 

Uses toast controller for pop-up notifcations
Uses nav controller for push to pages for navigation like on the Login Page if a user is wishing to register instead of login. 

Still need to get functionality for the user database set up. All attempts caused whole application to stop working due to numerous errors.
Future plans involve getting the database set up for login and register confirmation. Also, will move coffee grind and brewing information to that when it is working. 
Application could also be expanded to include different forms of coffee makers in the future as well.
